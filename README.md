# DHS Trusted Tester Course Notes

I am a [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional). I'm taking the [Section 508 training](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester) offered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) so I can get my [Section 508 Trusted Tester](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester) certification.

As I take the course, I'm taking notes here to act as a study guide and future reference for myself, and for others.

I will not be taking notes on things I already know, especially things that come from the CPACC training materials offered by [Deque Systems' Deque University CPACC and Web Accessibility Specialist courses](https://dequeuniversity.com/online-courses/web-accessibility).
I've taken [notes on the CPACC and WAS courses in another public repository](https://github.com/lortimer/IAAP-WAS-study-notes)
