Assistive Technology (AT)
: AT includes hardware or software that enables a person with a disability to use ICT

Content
: all forms of electronic information and data

Equivalent Facilitation
: Using an alternate design or technology that results in "substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability" by users with disabilities THAN WOULD BE PROVIDED BY the hardware or software requirements.

ICT
: Information and Communication Technology

Mode of Operation
: The manner in which a user experiences, interacts with, and operates ICT

: "The most common modes of operation for electronic content involve a combination of vision, hearing, and touch to view and/or listen to content and interact with it by physical manipulation of controls or via a graphical user interface." 

: I like this definition because it's human-centered and doesn't treat any one technology (like a mouse or monitor) as normal
